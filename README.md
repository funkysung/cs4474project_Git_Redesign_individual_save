## Authors

## Needed Dependencies

Should need npm installed in order to run the react page, running 'npm install' will initalize npm so that all needed dependencies are downloaded.

## Description

This program is a redesign of GitHub for CS4474. The purpose of the project is to take an existing desktop application (GitHub) and give a design overhaul\
using HCI design principles, to intend a better user experience. The program is created using javascript with react components. 

## How to Build

First ensure that NodeJS and NPM are installed on your machine (VS Code is recommended to ease building but not required)

They can be downloaded together here: https://nodejs.org/en/download (the 64 bit LTS is recommended) 

Then clone this repository using: git clone *clone url*

(if npm is not installed)
1. Navigate to the git_redesign folder (can be done from the parent folder 'cd git_redesign')
2. initialise npm in your project by typing 'npm install' in terminal, after this npm should be initialized
3. If the installation fails try it once or twice more

(after initialising npm)
1. Navigate to src folder
2. Run 'npm start' in terminal - runs the react app in the develpoment mode, where changes can be seen after saving files
3. Proceed to navigate through the program as need be, press Ctrl + c in terminal when finished to close
